### What I learned

Working on this project taught me a lot, not just about the technical side of things, but also about how to stay focused and problem-solve when things don’t go as planned. One of the biggest challenges I ran into was dealing with errors i didn’t expect—especially when handling data and trying to get certain features to work properly,understanding of core development principles such as clean code, modular design, and version control. There were moments where I felt stuck, but digging into documentation, trying different approaches worked out well.
